UC-1:

Metropolitan Urban Center District – mandates high intensity, transit-oriented,
mixed-use development in General Plan-designated metropolitan centers. These centers
are intended for a large-scale mix of uses comprised of multiple Urban Neighborhoods,
and are to be the most intense and least auto-dependent areas in Prince George’s County.
The Metropolitan Urban Center District is best described as a “downtown” district in
ultimate built character. Because of the access to regional fixed-guideway transit systems
and the scale of these centers, they are to be primary targets for employment, major
educational complexes, and high-intensity commercial uses in the county. The UC Zone
may only be approved for property subject to Subtitle 27A of the county code.

UC-2:

Regional Urban Center District – mandates moderately-scaled mixed-use, transit-oriented development generally consisting of two or more Urban Neighborhoods in a
town center setting. Regionally marketed commercial and retail centers, office and employment areas, and recreational complexes primarily serving Prince George’s County
are appropriate uses. High-density residential development should also be included. The
UC Zone may only be approved for property subject to Subtitle 27A of the county code.

UC-3:

Community Urban Center District – mandates a small- to moderate-intensity mix of uses
typically developed as a neighborhood “main street” with an adjacent Urban Neighborhood. Intended for the least intensive of the General Plan centers, this district shall
generally provide a mix of residential and business development to complement and
serve existing adjacent neighborhoods. Development may include higher intensity residential and non-residential mixed uses at appropriate locations along key transportation
routes. The UC Zone may only be approved for property subject to Subtitle 27A of the
county code.

UC-4:

Urban Corridor Node – promotes concentrated urban mixed-use, pedestrian-oriented
development with a limited, walkable size at designated locations along General Plan
corridors. This district shall generally provide a mix of uses that are smaller in scale to
complement and serve existing adjacent neighborhoods. Development may include limited higher intensity residential and non-residential mixed uses at appropriate locations

along key transportation routes. Compatibility with existing neighborhoods is essential.
The UC Zone may only be approved for property subject to Subtitle 27A of the county
code.
COMPREHENSIVE DESIGN ZONES

within the limits prescribed are allowed in return for public benefit features provided by the developer.)
